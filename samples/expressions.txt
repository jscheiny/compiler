fn example() {
    // Declare variables with let (maybe also mut in future if I want to support const-correctness)
    let x = 5; // type is inferred

    // Declarations shadow:
    let x = true; // from here out x has type bool

    // If statement
    if x {
        print("True");
    } else {
        print("False");
    }

    // If expressions
    let value = if x then 5 else 6;

    // Can create a new block to introduce a new lexical scope:
    {
        let x = "test";
        print(x);
    }
    // x is still bool in this scope

    // Blocks can also serve as expressions with their values being given by the prefix -> operator
    let y = {
        let x = 10;
        -> x * x;
    }; // y has value 100

    // Arrays are denoted as [T]
    let x: [bool] = [true, true, false];
    x(0) == 1; // No specific subscript operator, instead call arrays like functions
    // This means that arrays can be used as functions:
    let array_fn: int => bool = x;
    
    // While loops work exactly as you'd imagine:
    while y != 110 {
        y += 1;
        // Can use break and continue as normal
    }
