Notes:

Deferred access operator:
    .x    == a -> a.x
    .f(x) == a -> a.f(x)

General design note:
    Given f: (...Args) -> T
    f should be usable as a T:
    - f.x == (args) -> f(args).x
    - f + g == (args) -> f(args) + g(args)
    - f + c == (args) -> f(args) + c
    - c + f == (args) -> c + f(args)
